          <h3>CAPTAIN AMERICA</h3>
          <p>
            Captain America's civilian identity is Steve Rogers, a frail man
            enhanced to the peak of human physical perfection by an experimental
            "super-soldier serum" after joining the United States Army to aid
            the country's efforts in World War II.
            <br />
            <br />
            The character quickly emerged as Timely's most popular and
            commercially successful wartime creation upon his original
            publication, though the popularity of superheroes declined in the
            post-war period and Captain America Comics was discontinued in 1950.
            The character saw a short-lived revival in 1953 before returning to
            comics in 1964, and has since remained in continuous publication.
            Captain America's creation as an explicitly anti-Nazi figure was a
            deliberately political undertaking: Simon and Kirby were stridently
            opposed to the actions of Nazi Germany and supporters of U.S.
            intervention in World War II,

            <h4>Black Panther</h4>
            <p>
              After the death of his father, T'Challa returns home to the
              African nation of Wakanda to take his rightful place as king. When
              a powerful enemy suddenly reappears, T'Challa's mettle as king --
              and as Black Panther -- gets tested when he's drawn into a
              conflict that puts the fate of Wakanda and the entire world at
              risk. Faced with treachery and danger, the young king must rally
              his allies and release the full power of Black Panther to defeat
              his foes and secure the safety of his people.
